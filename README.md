# Project: Admin Dashboard

## Objective/s

This project is made exclusively with CSS grid. Although not required as instructed in the Odin Project's **[Intermediate HTML and CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css)**, I took it up as a challenge.

## Lessons Learned

-   CSS grid is a great tool at positioning elements in a two-dimensional way.
-   Be careful of which units to use for grids, consider if elements should dynamically resize or not.
-   Do not use CSS grid only, this is only done as a challenge. Realistically, you should use other layout methods depending on the situation.
-   Dev Tools are great tools in visualizing your grids.

## Things to Improve Upon

-   Using Chrome Dev Tools better.
-   Decide whether to commit with multiple files or not.
